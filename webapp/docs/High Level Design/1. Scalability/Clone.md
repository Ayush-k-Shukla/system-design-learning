## Key Points

- Public servers of a scalable web service are hidden behind a load balancer.
- Sessions must be stored in a centralized data store accessible to all application servers. This can be an external database or a persistent cache, such as Redis.
- To ensure the same updated code is running on every server, multiple tools can be used; one of them is Docker.
