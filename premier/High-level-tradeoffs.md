# High level Tadeoffs

## **Performance vs Scalability**

1.  If you will have performance issue your system will be slow for a single user
2.  if you will have scalability issue your system will be fast for a user but will be slow under heavy load
3.  **Performance** refers to how efficiently a system executes tasks under a specific workload. It focuses on response time, throughput and resource usage
4.  **Scalability** refers ability of a system to not degrade the performance under increased workload or growing user.

## **Latency vs Throughput**

1.  **Latency** is the time it takes a single request to be processed or a task to be completed. typically measured in milliseconds or seconds.
2.  **Throughput** refers to the rate at which a system process requests or tasks. typically measured in operations per second (ops), transactions per second.
3.  **Generally we thrive for maximal throughput with acceptable latency**

## **Availability vs consistency - see in page [Availability and Consistency](Availability-Consistency.md)**
